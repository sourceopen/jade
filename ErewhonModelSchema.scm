`This class is responsible for managing the search functionality for Items.

The main search operation is performed within the doSearch() method, which returns 
an ItemByCodeDict collection containing the Items found. By default, 
the search excludes items that have been sold and tenders that are closed. 
If you want to include these items in the search results, you can set the 
includeSoldItems and includeClosedTenders properties to true.

The myItems collection is marked as 'Exclusive' because it is exclusively used 
by the current class and is not embedded within the class structure. Consequently, 
the collection is automatically created and destroyed when the parent object is 
instantiated and destroyed, respectively. This design eliminates the need to create 
a temporary instance of the myItems collection in the constructor (create) method 
and avoids the necessity of deleting this temporary object in the destructor (delete) method. 
Thus, any potential memory leaks related to the transient mySaleItems object are prevented.`

`This Exception is raised by the ErewhonModelSchemaApp::raiseErewhonException method.

Creating exception classes is useful when you want to add additional properties
to your exceptions.  Even if you don't add additional properties, defining your own
exception classes is still useful as you can arm exception handlers specific to 
exception types and is useful for unit testing.

--------------------
RAISING AN EXCEPTION
--------------------
To raise an exception, call the ErewhonModelSchemaApp::raiseErewhonException method
and pass in the error code. Error codes should be saved as a global constant.  
The Erewhon error codes are saved in the Model Schema Global Constants (Ctrl + G) 
under the 'Erewhon Exceptions' category. 

------------------
CATCH AN EXCEPTION
------------------
To catch an exception, the method must be armed
For example: 

	begin
		on ErewhonException do app.exception_handler_abort_with_message(exception, title, message);
		
		// Code that could raise an exception ...
	end;

---------------------
HANDLING AN EXCEPTION
---------------------
Exception handlers are methods written to handle exceptions. 
Generic handlers should be saved in App (e.g. ErewhonModelSchemaApp) to promote
code reuse, but exception handlers can be located anwhere.
 
An example of a generic exception handler: 

	exception_handler_abort_with_message( pException : Exception; pTitle : String; pMessage : String ) : Integer;

	begin 
		abortTransaction;
		app.msgBox( pMessage, pTitle, MsgBox_OK_Only + MsgBox_Stop_Icon );
		return Ex_Abort_Action;
